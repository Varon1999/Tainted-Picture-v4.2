>Basic numbers connecting<

When lining up the bigger number such as 11 and higher,
add "jil" at the end of number 1-9

Example: Einjil Feth means 14


For hundred, add "til" at the end of any number from 1-9,
then combine them like normal, if the number is lined up like above,
combine the above rule as well.

Example: Eintil Lpijil Querz means 196


For thousand, add "serqoz" at the end of any number from 1-10,
then combine the above rules like normal, in this case
serqoz can include the number 10. The word "fain" means "and" and can be used like normal english
when listing numbers.

Example: "Reonserquoz" means 10,000
"Lpiserquoz Sointil Fain Uomjil Ein" means 9,381"


For ^ power / Square / Cube...
Add "Xerit" on any number ranged from 1-10, if the number
is higher than 10 and has "jil" at the end like "Sainjil",
always add it at the end like "Sainjilxerit" stands for power of 2
Rule: Any number that is inflicted with "Xerit" automatically becomes power of x and is
no longer a normal number. Therefore, you must add a real number before Xerit number to make sense

Question: Eisma Soin Sainxerit riveva a?
(What is 3 to the power of 2?)

Example: "Soin Sainxerit" means 3 with power of 2


For Decimal Point
Add "Post" at the end of the number, and then add the next number.

Example:
"Einserquoz Fain Querz Post Soin" means 1,006.2
